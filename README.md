# The hangman game

A simple console implementation of the hangman game.

The code here is the code of the (my) free e-book available on https://leanpub.com/learning-to-program-by-example

The only difference is that the committed version accepts an argument for the words dictionary.

## How to run the game

The game requires a _Ruby_ runtime (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

To run the game open a console:

```bash
ruby hangman.rb
```

Optionally, you can pass a words dictionary file, on Ubuntu you can use the `words` file as follows

```bash
ruby hangman.rb /usr/share/dict/words
```
